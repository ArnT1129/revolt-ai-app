# Demo vs User Account Separation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive changes made to separate demo functionality from real user accounts in the ReVolt AI battery analytics platform. The goal was to ensure that demo batteries are only accessible to demo users, and real users can properly save and manage their own batteries.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`supabase/migrations/20250714025836_quick_mountain.sql`)

**Added Demo User Tracking:**
- Added `is_demo` boolean column to profiles table
- Added `demo_created_at` timestamp column for tracking demo account creation
- Created `cleanup_demo_user_data()` function to clear demo data on sign out
- Added trigger to automatically clean up demo user data when they sign out

**Security Policies:**
- Simplified RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion
- Ensured users can only access their own data or company data they belong to

### 2. Demo Service Overhaul (`src/services/demoService.ts`)

**New Demo Account Management:**
- `isDemoUser()`: Check if current user is a demo user
- `markAsDemoUser()`: Mark user as demo in database
- `clearDemoUserData()`: Clear demo user data when they sign out
- `createDemoAccount()`: Create and manage demo account lifecycle
- `resetDemoAccount()`: Reset demo account data (clear uploads but keep hardcoded batteries)

**Demo Battery Management:**
- `getDemoBatteries()`: Get hardcoded demo batteries (only for demo users)
- `getDemoUploadedBatteries()`: Get uploaded demo batteries from localStorage
- `addDemoUploadedBattery()`: Add battery to demo uploads in localStorage
- `deleteDemoUploadedBattery()`: Delete battery from demo uploads
- `getAllDemoBatteries()`: Get all batteries for demo user (hardcoded + uploaded)

### 3. Battery Service Overhaul (`src/services/batteryService.ts`)

**Complete Separation of Demo and Real User Functionality:**

**For Demo Users:**
- All battery operations use localStorage only
- Cannot modify hardcoded demo batteries (IDs starting with 'DEMO-')
- Can upload and manage their own demo batteries
- Demo data is cleared on sign out

**For Real Users:**
- All battery operations use database only
- Can fully manage their own batteries
- Data persists until manually deleted
- No demo batteries shown

**New Methods:**
- `isDemoUser()`: Check if current user is demo
- `canModifyBattery()`: Check if battery can be modified
- `getBatteryById()`: Get battery by ID (works for both demo and real users)
- `deleteBattery()`: Delete battery (database for real users, localStorage for demo)

### 4. Authentication Context Updates (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Demo Account Lifecycle Management:**
- Proper demo account creation and management
- Automatic demo data cleanup on sign out
- Demo account reset on sign in
- No mock battery initialization for real users

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `initializeMockBatteries()` function
- Added demo user detection and data management
- Proper cleanup of demo data on sign out
- Demo account reset functionality

### 5. UI Component Updates

**Dashboard (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`):**
- Updated `handleSaveBattery()` to use `canModifyBattery()` check
- Prevents modification of hardcoded demo batteries
- Proper error handling for demo battery modifications

**Search Page (`src/pages/SearchPage.tsx`):**
- Updated `handleSaveBattery()` to use `canModifyBattery()` check
- Consistent demo battery protection

**File Uploader (`src/components/FileUploader.tsx`):**
- Updated `handleSaveBattery()` to use `canModifyBattery()` check
- Prevents modification of demo batteries through file uploads

**Auth Page (`src/pages/Auth.tsx`):**
- Updated to use `DemoService.createDemoAccount()`
- Proper demo account creation and management

### 6. Demo Account Lifecycle

**Demo Account Creation:**
1. User clicks "Try Demo Account"
2. `DemoService.createDemoAccount()` is called
3. Demo account is created or signed into
4. User is marked as demo in database
5. Demo account data is reset (fresh start)

**Demo Account Usage:**
1. Demo users see hardcoded demo batteries + any uploaded batteries
2. Can upload new batteries (stored in localStorage)
3. Cannot modify hardcoded demo batteries
4. Can modify their own uploaded batteries

**Demo Account Sign Out:**
1. All demo data is cleared from database
2. localStorage demo uploads are cleared
3. User is marked as no longer demo
4. Fresh start for next demo user

## Benefits of This Implementation

### 1. Complete Separation
- Demo and real user functionality are completely separate
- No cross-contamination between demo and real data
- Clear boundaries for data management

### 2. Proper Data Persistence
- Real users: Data persists in database until manually deleted
- Demo users: Data is cleared on sign out for fresh experience

### 3. Security
- Demo users cannot access real user data
- Real users cannot access demo data
- Proper RLS policies ensure data isolation

### 4. User Experience
- Demo users get a consistent, fresh experience each time
- Real users have persistent data management
- Clear error messages when trying to modify demo batteries

### 5. Scalability
- Easy to add more demo batteries
- Easy to modify demo account behavior
- Clean separation makes maintenance easier

## Testing Scenarios

### Demo User Flow:
1. Click "Try Demo Account"
2. See hardcoded demo batteries
3. Upload new battery (saves to localStorage)
4. Modify uploaded battery (allowed)
5. Try to modify hardcoded demo battery (blocked with error)
6. Sign out (all demo data cleared)
7. Sign back in (fresh demo experience)

### Real User Flow:
1. Create real account
2. No demo batteries shown
3. Upload batteries (saves to database)
4. Modify batteries (allowed)
5. Data persists across sessions
6. Sign out and back in (data still there)

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users:
- Real users will continue to see their existing batteries
- No demo batteries will be shown to real users
- All existing functionality preserved

### For Demo Users:
- Demo account will be properly marked in database
- Demo data will be cleared on sign out
- Fresh demo experience each time

## Future Enhancements

1. **Demo Account Expiration**: Add time-based expiration for demo accounts
2. **Demo Data Analytics**: Track demo usage patterns
3. **Multiple Demo Scenarios**: Different demo accounts for different use cases
4. **Demo Data Export**: Allow demo users to export their uploaded data before sign out

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust separation between demo and real user functionality while maintaining a smooth user experience. The demo system now properly isolates demo data from real user data, ensuring that demo users get a consistent experience and real users have persistent data management.
