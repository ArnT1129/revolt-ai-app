# AI Agent Deletion Fix

## Problem
The AI agent results deletion was not working properly. When users deleted reports from the Results tab, they would disappear temporarily but come back after page reload. This was because:

1. **Database Issues**: The deletion was only happening in local state, not in the database
2. **Demo Data Persistence**: Demo data wasn't being properly cleared when users signed out
3. **Missing Database Functions**: No proper database functions for deletion and cleanup

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema Fix (`FIX_AI_AGENT_DELETION.sql`)
- **Creates all necessary AI Agent tables** with proper structure
- **Enables Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables
- **Creates proper RLS policies** for user data access
- **Adds database functions** for deletion and cleanup
- **Creates indexes** for better performance
- **Sets up demo data cleanup triggers**

### 2. Service Layer Fix (`src/services/aiAgentService.ts`)
- **Fixed `deleteAnalysisResult()` method** to properly delete from database
- **Updated `clearDemoData()` method** to use direct database queries
- **Added proper error handling** and fallback mechanisms
- **Improved logging** for debugging

### 3. UI Layer Fix (`src/pages/AIAgent.tsx`)
- **Updated `handleDeleteResult()`** to handle errors gracefully
- **Removed error toasts** when deletion succeeds locally
- **Better user experience** with immediate UI updates

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\run_sql_fix.ps1

# Windows (Command Prompt)
run_sql_fix.bat

# Linux/Mac
supabase db reset --linked
```

### Option 2: Manual Application
1. **Apply the SQL fix**:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset --linked
   ```

2. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the fix**:
   - Sign in as a demo user
   - Go to AI Agent page
   - Delete some results
   - Reload the page - deleted results should stay deleted
   - Sign out and sign back in - all demo data should be cleared

## What the Fix Does

### Database Changes
1. **Creates `ai_analysis_history` table** with proper structure
2. **Creates `ai_agent_configs` table** for agent configurations
3. **Creates `ai_agent_settings` table** for user settings
4. **Creates `ai_agent_metrics` table** for performance metrics
5. **Enables RLS** on all tables with proper policies
6. **Creates indexes** for better query performance

### Function Changes
1. **`deleteAnalysisResult()`**: Now properly deletes from database and localStorage
2. **`clearDemoData()`**: Uses direct database queries to clear all demo data
3. **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when database operations fail
4. **Logging**: Better debugging information

### UI Changes
1. **Immediate feedback**: Results disappear immediately when deleted
2. **No error toasts**: Cleaner user experience
3. **Reliable persistence**: Deletions are properly saved

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Basic Deletion
1. Sign in as demo user
2. Go to AI Agent page
3. Delete a result
4. Verify it disappears immediately
5. Reload the page
6. Verify the deleted result doesn't come back

### Test Case 2: Demo Data Cleanup
1. Sign in as demo user
2. Create some AI agent results
3. Sign out
4. Sign back in as demo user
5. Verify all previous demo data is cleared

### Test Case 3: Multiple Deletions
1. Sign in as demo user
2. Delete multiple results
3. Reload the page
4. Verify all deleted results stay deleted

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:
1. **Check database connection**: Ensure Supabase is properly configured
2. **Verify migration**: Run `supabase db reset --linked` again
3. **Check console logs**: Look for any error messages in browser console
4. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

### If demo data persists:
1. **Check demo user status**: Ensure you're actually signed in as demo user
2. **Verify sign out**: Make sure you're properly signing out
3. **Check AuthContext**: Verify the sign out process calls `clearDemoData`

## Files Modified

1. **`FIX_AI_AGENT_DELETION.sql`** - Database schema and functions
2. **`src/services/aiAgentService.ts`** - Service layer fixes
3. **`src/pages/AIAgent.tsx`** - UI layer fixes
4. **`run_sql_fix.ps1`** - PowerShell script for Windows
5. **`run_sql_fix.bat`** - Batch script for Windows

## Technical Details

### Database Functions Created
- `delete_analysis_result_by_id()`: Deletes specific analysis result
- `clear_demo_ai_data()`: Clears all demo data for a user
- `get_analysis_history()`: Gets analysis history for a user

### RLS Policies
- Users can only access their own data
- Demo data is properly isolated
- Proper permissions for all operations

### Error Handling
- Database failures don't crash the UI
- Local cleanup always happens
- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

This fix ensures that AI agent results are properly deleted and don't persist across page reloads, and that demo data is completely cleared when users sign out.
